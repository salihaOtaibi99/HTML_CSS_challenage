        <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tag, incompatible <u>DOM</u>s, broken 
        <u>CSS</u> support, and abandond browser. </p>
        <br>

        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been archived thanks to the tireless efforts of
            folk like the <u>W3C</u>, <u>WaSP</u>, and the major browser creators. </p>

        <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the the masters. 
            Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techiques in new and invigorating fashion. 
            Become one with the web. </p>

        <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
        <p>
            There is a continuing need to show the power of <u>CSS</u>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and 
            encourage participation. To begin, view some of the exciting designs in the list. Clicking on any one 
            will load the style sheet into this very page. The <u>HTML</u> remains the same, the only thing that has 
            changed is the external <u>CSS</u> file. Yes, really.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <u>CSS</u> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be 
            illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are 
            placed in the hand of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contribute 
            to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

        <h2>Participation</h2>
        <p>
            Strong visual design has always been our focus. you are modifying this page, so string <u>CSS</u> skills 
            are necessary too, but example files are commented well enough that even <u>CSS</u> novices can use them 
            as starting points. Please see the <a href="">CSS Resource Guide</a> for advance tutorials and tips on working
            with <u>CSS</u>. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <u>HTML</u>. This may seem daunating 
            at first if you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample 
            files as a guide.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Download the sample <a href="">HTML</a> and <a href="">CSS</a> to work on a coby locally. Once you have 
            completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished work) upload your <u>CSS</u> file to 
            a web server under your control. <a href="">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated 
            assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.
